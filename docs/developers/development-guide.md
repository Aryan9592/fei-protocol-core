# Development Guide

## Protocol Development

Fei Protocol is completely controlled by the DAO at launch. The Fei Core Team has established the following suggested workflow for making protocol changes:

1. Propose idea in [\#development in Discord](https://discord.gg/p4jmUATf4C)
2. Informal discussion in Discord
3. Formal proposal on our forum
4. Snapshot voting on snapshot.page
5. If required, pull request to [fei-protocol-core](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pulls)
6. DAO proposal

### Pull Requests

To make a pull request with your changes, first create a branch with the name format `FIP-<number>-<description>`.

Members of the Fei Core Team and Fei community will review the changes, with major features having official audits from one of our audit partners. These audits will be sponsored by the core team, and you will get to work firsthand with the best auditors in the space.

### Making Proposals

See the Fei DAO section on how to make proposals and potentially having your proposal sponsored.

## Ecosystem Development

Fei Protocol is not an island. Our vision is to have many two-way integrations with other DeFi platforms including lending platforms, derivatives platforms, and AMMs. We also hope to have many community led bots, tooling, dashboards and even supporting features directly on Ethereum.

To pursue an integration with another platform, you will have to follow that platform's governance procedures and engage with that community. The Fei Core Team is excited to help sponsor community led integrations both with time and tokens.
