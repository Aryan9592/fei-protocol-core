# White Paper

The Fei Protocol white paper is meant to be a static document explaining the concept and inspiration for v1 of the protocol. We plan to leave it as it was at publication, after fixing a few typos found by the community. You can download the white paper here:

We have documented any changes to protocol functionality since the white paper in the changelog:

{% page-ref page="protocol/changelog.md" %}

If any feature changes major functionality in the protocol, we will likely publish individual feature white papers or articles as well.
