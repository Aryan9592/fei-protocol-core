# White Paper

The Fei Protocol white paper is a static document explaining the protocol's concept and inspiration for v1. We plan to leave it in its original form when published after fixing a few typos found by the community. You can download the white paper here:

We have documented any changes to the protocol functionality since the white paper in the changelog:

{% page-ref page="protocol/changelog.md" %}

If any feature changes major functionality in the protocol, we will likely publish individual feature white papers or articles as well.
