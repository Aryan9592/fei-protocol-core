description: The TRIBE governance token for Fei DAO

# Tribe

The TRIBE governance token is collectively responsible for managing the [Fei DAO](fei-dao.md). 

## Design

TRIBE's total initial supply is 1 billion. There is minting capability controlled by an appointed minter address \(this is different from the MinterðŸ’° role\). The minter is originally set to the Fei DAO Timelock.

The code for TRIBE is forked from the [Uniswap UNI token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984#code). The main difference is that UNI can only inflate 2% per year, whereas TRIBE has uncapped inflation.

## Distribution

The Fei Core team put a lot of thought into the initial TRIBE token distribution. We wanted it to be a balance between Community, Team, and Investors, prioritizing the Community. We also embedded both capital favoring and non capital favoring distribution mechanisms, and emphasized equal opportunity through the Genesis Group.

The high level distribution is:

* 40% DAO treasury
* 20% Initial DEX Offering
* 13% Fei Core Team
* 10% Genesis Group
* 10% Staking Rewards
* 5% Investors
* 2% Grants

Take a look at the Medium announcement for more details regarding the distribution.
