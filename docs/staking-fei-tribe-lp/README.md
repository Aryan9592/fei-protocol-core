# Staking FEI:TRIBE LP

[TRIBE](https://docs.fei.money/governance/tribe) is the Fei Protocol governance token. You can earn TRIBE [staking](https://docs.fei.money/protocol/staking) rewards by providing liquidity to [Uniswapâ€™s FEI-TRIBE pool](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x9928e4046d7c6513326ccea028cd3e7a91c7590a). To participate in this staking pool, you need to acquire FEI-TRIBE [LP Tokens](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/pools/).

Before participating in LP Pool Staking you should further research and explore the [risks and potential rewards](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/understanding-returns/) associated with providing staking pool liquidity. Loss of funds is possible due to a number of factors such as IL \(Impermanent Loss\), reward token \(TRIBE\) volatility, and associated transaction \([gas fees](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/)\) costs.

Fei Protocol staking pool is set for 2 years, with a linearly decreasing rate for reward release of 200M TRIBE tokens. Addtional program details and contracts available [here](https://docs.fei.money/protocol/staking).
