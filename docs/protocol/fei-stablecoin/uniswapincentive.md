# UniswapIncentive

## Contract

[UniswapIncentive.sol](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/UniswapIncentive.sol) implements [IUniswapIncentive](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/IUniswapIncentive.sol), [UniRef](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/refs/UniRef.sol)

## Description

The FEI incentive contract applied on transfers involving a Uniswap pair.

The UniswapIncentive contract assumes that all transfers involving Uniswap are either a sell or a buy. In either case, the hypothetical start and end price are calculated then compared to the peg to capture the magnitude distance _m_. See UniRef for more details on how these formulas are derived.

{% page-ref page="../references/uniref.md" %}

These parameters are fed into the incentive function to produce a mint \(in the case of buy\) or burn \(in the case of sell\) action. Any address can be exempted from incentives by governance.

### Sell \(Burn\)

All transfers going TO the uniswap pool are treated as a sell. This has the counterintuitive effect of treating liquidity provision as a sell.

The final magnitude _m_ deviation from the peg at the end of the hypothetical trade is used to calculate the burn amount. The burn formula for sell amount _x_ is: 

![Burn formula for UniswapIncentive](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-14-at-12.46.10-pm.png)

The burn is only applied to trades below the peg when incentive contract is appointed as a Burnerüî•.

#### Exclusive vs Inclusive Fees

An exclusive fee is implemented as an additional transfer beyond the expected transfer. i.e. when a sender transfers 100 FEI with a 1% exclusive fee, the recepient receives 100 FEI, and the sender is charged 1 FEI from their remaining balance.

An inclusive fee is implemented "in-flight" as a part of the transfer. i.e. when a sender transfers 100 FEI with a 1% inclusive fee, the recepient receives 99 FEI, since the recepient is charged 1 FEI from the transfered amount.

Fei Protocol uses an exclusive fee for the Direct Incentives. They have the advantage of not affecting the expected ERC-20 transfer behavior of equal debits and credits, which can lead to easier integrations. A noteworthy drawback is that if the sender is a pooled contract, then the pool could be forced to pay the burn on behalf of the sender. For this reason only approved addresses can sell directly on the FEI/ETH incentivized Uniswap pair.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only approved addresses can send FEI to Uniswap, blocking selling and liquidity provision.
{% endhint %}

The [FeiRouter](../trading/feirouter.md) is approved for selling and is the only way for end-users to sell FEI at launch.

Fei Protocol can use either inclusive or exclusive burn fees in the future, and even upgrade the existing exclusive fees to an inclusive type if needed.

### Buy \(Mint\)

All transfer going FROM the uniswap pool are treated as a buy. This has the counterintuitive effect of treating liquidity withdrawal events as buys.

The initial magnitude _m_ deviation from the peg before the hypothetical trade is used to maximize the potential mint amount. _w_ is the time weight we discuss in the next section. The mint formula for buy amount _x_ is: 

![Mint incentive formula for UniswapIncentive](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-14-at-12.58.57-pm.png)

Current implementation caps the mint function at 30% of the output of the burn function. This ensures that burns are always greater or equal for a given magnitude _m,_ regardless of the path taken to the current distance from the peg.

Since incentives are applied flatly over the entire trade size _x_, a series of smaller sells could end up with a lower burn than a single large sell. The amount paid in the best case is rarely below 30% of the worst case, hence we cap the reward at 30% of the worst-case burn to make sure the mint doesn't exceed some best-case burn and lead to a flash profit opportunity.

The mint should only apply if the trade starts below the peg, and if the incentive contract is appointed as a Minter.

### Time Weight

The time weight is a scaling factor to make the incentive structured more like an auction. The trader willing to accept the lowest mint will come in and buy first before the reward gets higher.

The time weight grows linearly at a rate set by governance. Its granularity is 100,000 per block. I.e. a growth rate of 1000 would increment the weight by one unit every 100 blocks. It should only grow while "active" and will only be active when the last trade ended below the peg.

Trades should update the time weight as follows:

* If ending above peg, set to 0 and deactivate
* If ending below the peg but starting above, set to 0 and activate
* If starting and ending below peg, update pro-rata with a buy based on percent towards peg. For example, if trade starts at 10% deviation and ends at 1%, time weight should be scaled by 1%/10% =.10.
* If starting and ending below the peg, cap the time weight at the max incentive for the ending distance

### Incentive Parity

Incentive parity is defined as a boolean which is true when the mint incentive equals its max, i.e. the adjusted burn incentive. 

![Condition for incentive parity](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-14-at-1.13.12-pm.png)

Parity is used as a trigger condition for reweights in the [UniswapPCVController](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/wiki/UniswapPCVController)
