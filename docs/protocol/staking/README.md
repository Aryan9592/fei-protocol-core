# Staking

#### Pool

The staking pool will take in FEI/TRIBE Uniswap LP tokens and reward with TRIBE tokens. The total reward balance is 10% of the initial TRIBE supply distributed over 2 years. The rewards decrease linearly so they are front loaded. Our novel pool contract has the benefit of being completely fluid with no epochs. Traders can deposit, withdraw, and claim whenever they want. This does come with a side effect of dilution on unclaimed balances. To improve returns in the staking pool we recommend claiming weekly.  We'll have documentation explaining the math and specifics behind how the pool works before launch.
