# White Paper

The Fei Protocol white paper is meant to be a static document explaining the concept and inspiration for v1 of the protocol. We plan to leave it as it was at publication, after fixing a few typos found by the community. You can download the white paper here:

We have documented any changes to protocol functionality between the white paper and Genesis Group launch below:

{% page-ref page="implementation-vs-whitepaper-diff.md" %}

Once the protocol is live, we plan on including each new feature or update in a changelog here in the documentation. If the feature changes major functionality in the protocol, we will likely publish individual feature white papers or articles as well.
